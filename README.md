My front-end web development starter kit.

## Instructions

This project depends on Bower, Gulp and SCSS. Be sure you are comfortable using these tools with the command line before you get started. 

1. Download the zip from this page. You can rename the extracted folder to whatever you want.

2. Navigate to the folder using terminal or console if you're on a PC. 

3. Run `bower install` to grab the latest version of Bootstrap. 

4. Install the gulp packages using `npm install`. 

5. Run the `gulp` command. 

At this point the initials tasks will be run and a webserver should be running at <a href=" http://localhost:8000" target="_blank"> http://localhost:8000</a>. 

Time to get to work!
